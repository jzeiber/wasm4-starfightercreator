# Use

## Controls
- Left click on the grid will perform the action of the option selected on the right
- Left click on an option on the right will select it
- Right click on the grid will delete the vertex below the mouse
- Middle click on the gird will select the vertex below the mouse

Create your starfighter using the mouse/touch controls.  You can place vertices up to 10 vertices in the grid in the upper left.  Vertices are mirrored left/right, so you only need to add the vertex to the left or right side of the grid and it will be mirrored on the opposite side.  The top of the screen corresponds to the front of the ship.  You must choose one of the vertices as the vertex where your weapons will fire from.

When you ship has a valid configuration,  you will see a security code that represents the ship.  Write this security code down to use the ship in Starfighter Arena.

## Options (Click the option to select it, then left click on the grid to perform that action)
- Add Vertex - Adds a new vertex (after the last vertex) at the grid point under the mouse
- Delete Vertex - Removes a vertex at the grid point under the mouse
